I am a computational plasma physicist currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I currently work with Dr. Alec Thomas at the GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science.

Research Interests
---
My current research interests are in the development of different physics packages and algorithms that can be included in various particle-in-cell (PIC) codes. In particular, I am currently working on a collisional ionization package that will be included in the PIC code Osiris, developed out of GoLP-IST and UCLA.
