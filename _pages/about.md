I am a computational plasma physicist who recently received a Ph.D. in Physics and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I currently work with [Dr. Alec Thomas](https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/researchgroups/hfs/profiles/alexander-thomas/) at the [GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science](https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/).

Research Interests
---
My current research interests are in developing different physics packages and algorithms that can be included in various particle-in-cell (PIC) codes. In particular, I am currently working on a collisional ionization package that will be included in the PIC code Osiris, developed by GoLP-IST and UCLA.
