I am a computational plasma physicist and received my Ph.D. in Physics and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2024. During my time as a graduate student, I worked with [Prof. Alec Thomas](https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/researchgroups/hfs/profiles/alexander-thomas/) at the [GÃ©rard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science](https://cuos.engin.umich.edu/), and ultimately graduated with a dissertation titled ["On the Role of Ionization Physics in Intense Laser-Plasma Interactions."](https://dx.doi.org/10.7302/23802) I am currently a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan designing new tools and algorithms for kinetic codes to model the evolution of photoionized electrons in plasmas.

Research Interests
---
My current research interests are in developing different physics packages and algorithms that can be included in various large-scale scientific projects. Currently my work is focused on particle-in-cell (PIC) and other kinetic codes used to model plasmas. I have prior experience creating a collisional ionization package included in the PIC code Osiris, developed by GoLP-IST and UCLA.
